*Dont get freaked out about "prompt engineering"... its just about learning how to speak and delegate well :)*

Good prompt ---> Great Prompt

## Prompting is just a skillset

Turning things that are a pain, to take a few seconds using AI- telling Ai what we would like it to generate.
Be precise in defining what we need- its the same way I would ask an employee and team mate for what i need them to do / achieve #LeadingAndManaging/HowToAskAnEmployeeWhatToDo
So for me this will be a great way to learn to lead better as well- how to communicate with anyone and explain what exactly Im looking for.

## What I'll be able to do
- Framework for writing prompts 
	- (i want to distill this into an interface so that it just makes working with Ai easier and faster)
	- I should be able to add a backend of AI to this so that it can not just create a generic one size fits all prompt
		- I want to exploit certain AI modules strengths:
			- Dolphin (for uncensored results - broader perspective)
			- Perplexity (more recent data- market research etc thats relevant to the day)
			- Claude.ai or Llama for private information
			- Deep seek
- Create AI Agents *fancy word for a specialized type of employee - Business developer, customer care agent etc*
- Distill projects that I'm working on into insights that are easy to present or convey
	- Can turn it into presos for showcasing in a portfolio etc
- Untangle complex tasks
	- Make long term projects easier to plan and execute (Thinking about service design here where I'd need to be able to define a target audinence, spagetti diagram the conversations between the business and the client, turn it into user journey stages, analyse which back end and front end systems they engage with and lastly how to create an intuitive expereince for everyone concerned)
- Fact checking of outputs
	- They say that the AI tool doesnt do this, but thats fine, thats what #Ai/Agents  are for
		- Create an AI agent for Quality assurance
- Prompt creation can become an #Ai/Agents - that learns and gets better each time.

## AI to benefit people and society

Everyone is needing to learn prompting (*Its like everyone is now learning to manage and lead, because each person is going to be managing and leading #Ai/Models*)
